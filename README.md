# Twilify
Generate a Spotify playlist based on your current musical interests or mood by texting a Twilio-owned phone number which triggers a Cloud API in your personal account.
Easy AWS or GCP-based serverless deployment automated via Terraform.

## Current Version: 2.0.0 - Multi-Cloud (AWS & GCP) Support
One-script installation/deployment into AWS or GCP (why not both? ;) and automated Twilio webhook configuration for easy use. Once texted, initial playlist is created with name "Twilify" within seconds. Experiment with personalized playlist customization through text-based keywords, grant your friends permission to text the app themselves, investigate a hit new track and see how it was generated, but most importantly - quit trying to decide what music to listen to!

# Installation

## Prerequisites
* AWS CLI or gcloud - https://aws.amazon.com/cli/ or https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
* Python3 (required for installation script)
* Terraform configured with AWS or GCP - https://www.terraform.io/
* A Twilio phone number capable of sending/receiving SMS - https://console.twilio.com/
    * As of July 2023, a verified A2P campaign is required for CPaaS usage, several days to get approved for personal use-case
* A Spotify account
* A Spotify application created at https://developer.spotify.com/ allowing API access to your account

## Instructions
1. To start install, ```cd installation/```
2. Provide values for variables in terraform.auto.tfvars file - account/project ID, Spotify account, Twilio number, etc
    * For information around obtaining these values, see below section
    * If hosting Twilify in AWS, remove gcp variables: gcp_project_id, gcp_region
    * If hosting Twilify in GCP, remove aws variables: aws_account_id, aws_region
3. Execute install.sh script and indicate which Cloud provider to use
    * For AWS: ```./install.sh aws```
    * For GCP: ```./install.sh gcp```
4. Text your Twilify number to say hi, and enjoy your new playlist :)


## Determining tfvars Values

### Cloud Variables
* aws_account_id or gcp_project_id: Login to Cloud console and grab 12-digit AWS account ID or GCP project ID string
* aws_region or gcp_region: Region where Twilify should be deployed in Cloud, i.e. us-east-1 or similar for AWS, us-east1 or similar for GCP

### Spotify Variables
* spotify_user_id: Login to Spotify and find string of digits on account page
* spotify_client_id and spotify_client_secret: Login to https://developer.spotify.com/, select your Twilify application, obtain values from settings page

### Twilio Variables
* twilio_account_sid and twilio_auth_token: Login to https://console.twilio.com/, navigate to your Twilio project, obtain values from Account Info panel
* twilio_number: In same Twilio project, navigate to Phone Numbers->Manage->Active Numbers and copy value including +1 extension, i.e. "+12325556666"
* twilio_number_sid: After copying twilio_number, click on the number and navigate to Properties tab to obtain SID
* allowed_user_numbers: List of numbers (with +1 extension) that should be allowed to text Twilify and trigger playlist generation, i.e. ["+12325556666", ...]

# Usage

- In general, texting Twilify will replace all songs in the Twilify playlist with the default number of new songs (set as Terraform var)
- Songs will be generated by randomly combining 1-3 songs in a user's Spotify current top tracks as seeds for new song generation
- For more customizable playlist, several keywords can be included in the text body, see table below
- Case does NOT matter for your SMS messages, don't worry about auto-caps!

# Uninstall
1. Execute "terraform destroy" to get rid of everything in AWS or GCP, delete the playlist in Spotify, and don't forget to release the Twilio number. Poof, it's all gone.


# Backlog
- Use S3 bucket keys for KMS encryption to reduce cost 
- Need ability to accidentally delete spotify playlist and resume without having to recreate songbank, migrate keyword
- alert all registered numbers when fresh music is ready (can opt out via text?)
- "classic" song keyword, want to mostly enjoy new stuff or sing to what you already love? - long term favs
- Want endless keyword so playlist keeps refreshing with new tracks as I listen without needing to text every so often, until I stop the endlessness via text
- Add S3 bucket versioning to be able to lookup previous songbanks if desired, lifecycle policy to minimize storage costs


# Completed Work

- Support for deploying into Google Cloud and AWS
- Spotify refresh token saved as SSM Parameter Store as encrypted string, not in S3 with songbank
- Fixed bug: Twilify doesn't immediately respond with warmup message - switched to serverless instead of VPC
- Songbank keeps track of / increments play count for songs even when removed from playlist
- Fixed bug: Twilify can fail when writing new songbank back to S3, put object call is timing out - added network connectivity check at start and max retries/timeouts added for boto3, verified retries via CloudWatch logs
- Fixed bug: Spotify calls timing out retrieving refresh token - switched to serverless instead of VPC
- Fixed bug: Twilify silently fails when texted during network stack deletion - switched to serverless instead of VPC
- Twilify ignores existing Spotify playlists with same name upon app setup, will create new playlist instead of choosing existing - use overwrite keyword to use existing
- Setup script invokes Twilio API to update phone number instead of manually copy/pasting with MFA login
- Fixed bug: Playlist doesn't have correct number of songs after songbank reset
- Completely serverless architecture
- Specify that songs are kept via Hello text - keep keyword
- Happy/sad keywords to influence playlist tracks 
- Tempo keyword to influence playlist tracks
- Instrumental keyword for playlist, if present less/minimal vocals
- Energy keyword - energy high, medium, or low
- Dance keyword - want danceable tracks
- Size keyword temporarily changes number of songs in playlist - can't use with 'keep' unless desired size is larger than current playlist size
- Seeds keyword along with track number in playlist provides which songbank songs were used to generate the playlist song - songbank keeps track of 'parents'
- Songbank contains basic song metadata instead of just spotify IDs
- Single Twilify deployment supports receiving messages from multiple users to trigger playlist generation


- [BACK-BACKLOG] Multiplayer joint playlists with song generation distributed between friends??? - OK, Spotify pretty much stole this idea ;)
